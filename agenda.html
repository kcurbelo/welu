Not only is medical marijuana use increasing, but access to recreational use is growing and expected to dramatically increase. How should your company come to terms with marijuana and even with prescription drug use?

	    <a name="compensation"><h4>Compensation Analysis:  Alleviating Pay Gaps (breakout session in Anaheim only)</h4></a>
	    <p> As the current Administration has stepped up its efforts to close "wage gaps”"between protected groups, the OFCCP has ramped up its enforcement of equal pay laws, including rewriting how it investigates compensation practices. As a result, now more than ever, it's important to proactively analyze your pay data for potential discrimination before the federal government comes knocking on your door. The presentation will address these timely critical subjects:  (1) the latest OFCCP enforcement guidelines; (2) potential employer liabilities; (3) mitigation of pay disparity liabilities, techniques and tools analyze data; and (4) benefits of implementing a pay equity program within the organization. This program is suitable not only for employers who fall under the OFCCP guidelines, but also for any employer seeking to establish a sound and equitable compensation program. </p>
